## Analyzing CIA Factbook Data on Countries Using SQL

In this project, I use SQL to extract interesting insights from this SQLite [database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db). It contains data from the [CIA factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. 
The database contains information such as:
- `name` — the name of the country.
- `area` — the country's total area (both land and water).
- `area_land` — the country's land area in square kilometers.
- `area_water` — the country's waterarea in square kilometers.
- `population` — the country's population.
- `population_growth` — the country's population growth as a percentage.
- `birth_rate` — the country's birth rate, or the number of births per year per 1,000 people.
- `death_rate` — the country's death rate, or the number of death per year per 1,000 people.

This project is a part of the [Data Scientist in Python](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist) course on Dataquest.
